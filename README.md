# arduino-frequency-shift-keying-rtty

With thanks to The UKHas (https://ukhas.org.uk/guides:linkingarduinotontx2), this example was written to help me understand how RTTY and Frequency Shift Keying works.

I'm hoping to evolve this into a fully fledged library.

Currently it is designed to take serial input, and transmit RTTY.
